        Portofino is a port city in the region of <strong class="bold-text">Liguria</strong> that is now known for its beautiful 
        landscape and buildings. Portofino, however, has deep historical roots dating back to <strong class="bold-text">Roman</strong>
        times where it served as a port and a fishing village. During these times, the houses began to
        be painted in bright colors for sailors to recognize the port that they were looking to dock 
        at. Due to the colorful nature of the city and the environment, Portofino was later determined
        to be an admirable place to live and has been a monument of leisure to those on the coast.
